        * Performance Rating Distribution
        * Absenteeism Rate

3.  **Dashboard Design and Interactivity:**

    * The dashboard was designed with a focus on user experience, clarity, and interactivity.
    * Appropriate visualizations were chosen to represent different types of HR data, including:

        * Bar charts for comparisons (turnover by department)
        * Heatmaps for visualizing performance ratings
        * Pie charts for distribution analysis ( employee demographics)
        * Tables for detailed data views
    * Interactive elements such as filters, parameters, and actions were implemented to allow users to:
        * Filter data by department, location, or other relevant dimensions.
        * Drill down into specific data points for more detail.
        * Compare performance across different groups.
